# Yoga-Pose-comparison-using-PoseNet

In this project, We have created an Yoga AI instructor which helps in correcting your poses. We have used PoseNet for image identification and detecting joint location.
We are using Cosine-similarity for generating scores for poses. We have used flask for web deployment
